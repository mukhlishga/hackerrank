SQL database Normalization

relation = table
attribute = column of table
key attribute = primary key = prime attribute = column that can be used as primary/foreign key
candidate key = column that can be key attribute
tuple = a set of columns can be a joint primary key (composite key)

1NF
requirement: if the table contains no multi-valued attributes (no table inside table). several 1NF tables can be joined based on key
violation: There is multi-value attribute/table inside table

2NF:
requirement: if it satisfies 1NF, and every (not only a part) non-key attribute is functionally dependent on the whole of every candidate key. 
violation: If only a part/subset of the primary key determines any attribute, there is a “partial dependency”, and the tableis not in 2NF.

3NF:
requirement: if it satisfies 1NF and s2NF, and if no functional dependency between two or more non-key attributes (transitive dependency)
violation: If a non-prime attribute determines another non-prime attribute, there is a transitive dependency, and the table is not in 3NF. 
	--> will create insertion, deletion, and modification anomalies
goals: reduce the duplication of data, avoid data anomalies, ensure referential integrity, and simplify data management.
violation example: a table containing ZIPCODE(s) and CITY with MANY-TO-ONE relationship in one table 
	--> MANY-TO-ONE means ZIPCODE(s) and CITY are not primary key --> a non-prime to non-prime dependency (transitive dependency) is present

Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):
requirement: if it satisfies 1NF and s2NF and 3NF, and every determinant (antecedent in a functional dependency/X in FD: X -> Y) is a candidate key.
violation: if a non-prime attribute determines prime attribute, the table is not in BCNF

Database Normalization #1 - 1NF
The following unnormalized table named PRODUCT is transformed to first normal form (1NF) by splitting it into two tables which have X and Y rows (such that X <Y) respectively. 
Both the tables have Z columns.
*Product-ID*    *Colors*    *Price*
1               Red,Green   15.0
2               Blue        18.0
3               Yellow,Pink 2.5
What are the values of X, Y, Z?
answer: 3,5,2

Database Normalization #2 - 1/2/3 NF
A particular database is normalized to satisfy a particular level of normalization (either 1NF or 2NF or 3NF). 
One of the tables contains, among other fields, a column for the City and a column for the Zip Code. 
Assuming that there is a many-to-one mapping between the set of Zip Code(s) and City, we may conclude that the database is definitely NOT in NF form. 
What is the integer x (1, 2, or 3)? Fill your answer in the text box below.
answer: 3 (not a NF3)

Database Normalization #3
A database used by a college’s application stores the relationship between students and the courses they are enrolled in. We have information for each STUDENT 
(such as name, date of birth, date of enrollment, student-id) and COURSE (course code, instructor, etc.). In real life, a student takes several courses simultaneously 
while a subject is studied by several students. We need to capture this many-to-many relationship in our database. From the above information, 
what is the minimum number of tables required to structure this database in accordance with the rules of 2NF normalization?
answer: 3 (many-to-many need 3 tables including pivot table)

Database Normalization #4
A database, normalized as per 2NF rules, has been split into 10 tables. Each of the tables has exactly two columns: one key attribute and one non-key attribute. 
What is the minimum number of tables required to express this database in 3NF form? Enter the integer in the text box below. Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.
answer: 10 (its already NF3)

Database Normalization #5
Consider the following relation and determinants.
R(a, b,c,d)
                   a,c -> b,d
                   a,d -> b
        Also, a,b is a primary key for the above relation.
The above relation is in x NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.
What is the maximum possible value of x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form?
Your answer should only be restricted to one of these numbers:1/2/3/3.5 Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.
answer: 3

Database Normalization #6
Let us take the example of a simple movie library. Each movie has a description, director, and serial number. Customers have a name, address, and membership number. Assume only one copy of each movie exists in the library. We are given the following relations and determinants. The keys for each relation are CAPITALIZED.
Relations (The key is CAPITALIZED):
customer(name,addr,MEMBERNO)
movie(DESCRIPTION,director,serialno)
borrow(memberno,DATE,SERIALNO)
Determinants:
description->director,serialno
serialno->description
serialno->director
name,addr -> memberno
memberno -> name,addr
serialno,date -> memberno
The above relation is in x**NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.
What is the maximum possible value of **x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form?
Your answer should only be restricted to one of these numbers:1/2/3/3.5 Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.
asnwer: 2 (there is transitive dependency in movies table: serialno->director which is a non-prime to non-prime dependency)

Database Normalization #7
Let us take the example of a simple movie library. Each movie has a description, director, and serial number. Customers have a name, address, and membership number. Assume only one copy of each movie exists in the library. We are given the following relations and determinants:

serial(SERIALNO,director)
customer(name,addr,MEMBERNO)
borrow(memberno,DATE,SERIALNO)
Determinants:
description->director,serialno
serialno->description
serialno->director
name,addr -> memberno
memberno -> name,addr
serialno,date -> memberno
The above relation is in x**NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.

Database Normalization #10
The following table stores rows of information about pizza deliveries. The three columns correspond to the Restaurant name, Crust, Delivery Area. We convert this table into Fourth Normal Form and so we end up creating two tables, each with two columns and N rows. (Both the new tables have an equal number of rows)
